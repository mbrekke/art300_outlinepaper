        <p>
            According to healthline.com, food allergy is when the body is exposed to a certain food and a harmful response is triggered. The immune system attacks proteins in the food that are usually not a threat to people without the allergy. An allergen is the thing that triggers the harmful immune system response. Severity of a reaction depends on the person and how sensitive they are to the allergen. Some people just have a sensitivity, which means the reaction that you have is caused by the digestive system, while others have an actual allergy which takes place in the immune system. Some people have mild reactions, which can cause an itchy mouth and throat and hives, and some people have severe, which causes throat tightening, difficulty breathing, and can send the person into anaphylactic shock. There are eight major food allergens (Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, and shellfish), but there are over 170 foods that have been reported to cause allergic reactions.

        <p>
            According to done by the Food Allergy Research and Education group, it is suspected that 32 million Americans have food allergies, 5.6 million of those being children. 40 percent of children with food allergies are allergic to more than one substance.

        <h4>
            Subpoint 1: Bring in more money
        </h4>
        <p>
            If a restaurant is more flexible and open with its options, more patrons would be able to eat there, thus causing them to collect more revenue. Many alternatives for food are even upcharged, again bringing in more money for the restaurant.

            Subpoint 2: Better reviews
        </h4>
        <p>
            If someone with a food allergy eats at a place that has options for them, they are highly likely to eat there again and even tell others with allergies that the restaurant caters to those with food allergies, which would make more customers happy and it would reflect well onto the restaurant that. It would broadcast that the restaurant has options for everyone and cares enough about the customers to put in the extra effort to make sure that they can safely eat.
